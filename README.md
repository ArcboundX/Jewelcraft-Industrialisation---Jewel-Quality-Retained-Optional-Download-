# Jewelcraft 1.5.3 /Industrialisation - Jewel Quality Retained (Optional modification for users of both mods) 
An optional modification to undare's Jewelcraft to give it synergy with DraLUSAD's Industrialisation, this will make sure that the jewels for which you've improved quality in Industrialisation's Gem Polisher will translate into Jewelry or Faberge Eggs of the same quality when used in any of the 3 Jewelcraft's machines.

For example, an Iridium quality Diamond will translate into an Iridium quality Faberge egg, or an Iridium quality Jewel. Either of these can be later on, enchanted, and the enchanted Jewel/Faberge will also retain it's quality.

In addition i include a modification to Industrialisation to allow for all minerals/artifacts used by Jewelcraft to be polished in the Gem Polisher up to iridium qual.

To install: 
1) Simply install Jewelcraft 1.5.3: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1861
2) Install Industrialisation https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3034?tab=files
2) Drag the 4 folders in this github to your mods folder and let them replace all files. (It's just 4 files regardless.)

*Technical Notes: 

The 3 files modified for Jewelcraft are FabergeBench.json / Jewelcraftingtables.json and enchantingtablex.json, adding 3 extra entries to each product of each crafting table to account for the 3 missing qualities, and the file modified for Industrialisation is isdve.json, adding all missing artifacts/minerals to the Gem Polisher. While i'm pretty sure i didn't miss any, i can't test this for all possible entries, so if you happen to be unable to use a jewel of a specific quality on any of the machines, let me know so that i can fix it. Still, pretty sure each one is accounted for.

It has recently been pointed out to me that using "quality= -1" instead of creating entries for each mineral/artifact can help streamline everything, which would allow for much easier updating in the future. However at the present this solution has problems, so it's up for grabs for anyone knowledgeable with CFR willing to give it a shot.

It goes without saying, this modification is meant for Jewelcraft ver. 1.5.3, and the latest Industrialisation build (19/sept) if these mods change in the future, the extra entries will have to be added all over again to the new ver. files. Regardless, even if i don't myself, anyone with a text editor can do it.

Hopefully this is useful to someone else out there. 
It goes without saying that all credit belongs solely to the mod authors, this is just a modification i conceived for personal use, but here it is in case someone else gets a kick out of it.
