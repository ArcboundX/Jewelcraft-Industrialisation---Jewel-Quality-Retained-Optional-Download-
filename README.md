# Jewelcraft-Industrialisation---Jewel-Quality-Retained-Optional-Download-
An optional modification to undare's Jewelcraft to give it synergy with 1059Studio's Industrialisation, this will make sure that the jewels for which you've improved quality in Industrialisation's Gem Polisher will translate into Jewelry or Faberge Eggs of the same quality when used in any of the 3 Jewelcraft's machines.

For example, an Iridium quality Diamond will translate into an Iridium quality Faberge egg, or an Iridium quality Jewel. Either of these can be later on, enchanted, and the enchanted Jewel/Faberge will also retain it's quality.
