# Jewelcraft 1.5.3 /Industrialisation - Jewel Quality Retained (Optional-Download) 
An optional modification to undare's Jewelcraft to give it synergy with DraLUSAD's Industrialisation, this will make sure that the jewels for which you've improved quality in Industrialisation's Gem Polisher will translate into Jewelry or Faberge Eggs of the same quality when used in any of the 3 Jewelcraft's machines.

For example, an Iridium quality Diamond will translate into an Iridium quality Faberge egg, or an Iridium quality Jewel. Either of these can be later on, enchanted, and the enchanted Jewel/Faberge will also retain it's quality.

To install: 
1) Simply install Jewelcraft 1.5.3: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1861
2) Drag the 3 folders in this github to your mods folder and let them replace all files. (It's just 3 files regardless.)

*Technical Notes: 

The 3 files modified are FabergeBench.json / Jewelcraftingtables.json and enchantingtablex.json, adding 3 extra entries to each product of each crafting table to account for the 3 missing qualities. While i'm pretty sure i didn't miss any, i can't test this for all possible entries, so if you happen to be unable to use a jewel of a specific quality on any of the machines, let me know so that i can fix it. Still, pretty sure each one is accounted for.

It goes without saying, this modification is meant for Jewelcraft ver. 1.5.3, if the mod changes in the future, the extra entries will have to be added all over again to the new ver. files. Regardless, even if i don't myself, anyone with a text editor can do it.

*Important Note:

While this modification allows The Jewelcraft machines to process all faberge/jewelry materials at any quality, at the moment Industrialisation's Gem Polisher can only process Topaz, Diamond, Ruby, Amethyst, Aquamarine, Jade, Emerald and Prism. Shard. 
I plan to add the missing entries to the Gem Polisher in the near future, and it should be posted here.

Hopefully it's useful to someone else out there, good luck.
